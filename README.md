# Kickit Habit Tracker
WEBSITE LINK: https://kickithabittracker.com/

Full stack web application deployed using ASP.NET MVC and hosted on Microsoft Azure that helps users track habits

To download and run this application locally, edit the "appsettings.json" file with your local database information as the the default connection string.

## Overview
Kickit is an online habit tracker. Users can add and remove habits they would like to track. 
Once a user has completed a habit, the user can update the habit as “Completed”. The habits will always reset to “Not Completed” 
at midnight every night (as long as you are in the same time zone as you were when you updated the task as “Completed”). 
If the user forgets to log out, the application will automatically log the user out after 30 minutes.

## Why I Created This Project
My reason for creating Kickit was to learn more about the full stack web development process. 
I chose a habit tracker web application because I have always loved self improvement, so I thought a habit tracker would be a useful tool 
for anyone looking improve themselves.
